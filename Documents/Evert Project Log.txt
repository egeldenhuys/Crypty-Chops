Created functions for Adding, Storing and modifying the information
about files the user provides and display them in a list.

Only problem is the functions assume the list is in the same
order as the array. If the list is sorted they will no longer
function as normal.

Need to investigate the use of keys, and possibly use
them to link to the array.

Changed the problem definition to be more simple and describe the 
process the user needs to go through to encrypt/decrypt a single file.
Can still be improved.
