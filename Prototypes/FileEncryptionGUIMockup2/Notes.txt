This doesn't have any functionality it's just to see how our screen design looks. I think something looks off about the list view, I don't know how to space it to make it look good haha


Evert:
Interface looks good.

Modifications:

	+ Added buttons below the list view. This will give first time users some direction until
		they learn they can access files directly from the list. Also gives a quick overview of
		the features of the program.


	+ Added 'View Help' to the 'Help' item in the menu strip. 
		When the user selects this they will be displayed the
		documentation of the program. Either in another form or in a web browser.
	
	+ Added'About' in 'Help'. Displays information about the program Such as Developers, version, date released,
		What the program does etc.

	+ Added 'File Information' Group box. This will display information on the selected file.
		This might not be necessary as the information will already be displayed in the list.
		It does however give more space to display information and makes the interface look more even.
		Will remove if it makes the interface look cluttered and provides no extra functionality.

Modifications:

	+ Added mockup encrypt form. It seems a bit cluttered and could be set out better but I guess it's a starting point.

	+ Added mockup decrypt form. Same from encrypt form.

	+ Added simple mockup add file functionality. Just made it open an Open File Dialog.

	+ Added mockup about form. Still have to add information to it although it adds the version and title and stuff to it automatically. Maybe we should decide on a company name sort of thing?

Robert:
Key preview must be set to true on the form otherwise the shortcuts won't work.
